SELECT *, Price, CAST(REPLACE(Price, '$', ' ')AS UNSIGNED) AS price_clean
FROM listings;

SELECT id, listing_url, name, 30 - availability_30 AS booked_out_30,
CAST(REPLACE(Price, '$', ' ') AS UNSIGNED) AS price_clean,
CAST(REPLACE(Price, '$', ' ') AS UNSIGNED)*(30 - availability_30) AS proj_rev_30
FROM listings ORDER BY proj_rev_30 DESC LIMIT 20;

SELECT * FROM reviews
INNER JOIN listings ON reviews.listing_id = listings.id
WHERE comments LIKE "%dirty%"
GROUP BY host_id, host_url, host_name ORDER BY num_dirty_reviews DESC;
