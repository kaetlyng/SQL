In this SQL project, I am analyzing data from Taste of the World Cafe to see what 
menu items are doing well and what the top customers seem to like best.


-- 1. Combine the menu_items and order_details tables into a single table
SELECT *
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id;

-- 2. What were the least and most ordered items and what categories were they in
SELECT item_name, COUNT(order_details_id) AS num_purchases
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY item_name
ORDER BY num_purchases DESC;

-- 3. What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money
SELECT order_id, SUM(price) AS total_spend
FROM order_details od 
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY total_spend DESC;

-- 4. View the details of the highest spend order
SELECT category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od 
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id = 440
GROUP BY category;

-- 5. View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders
SELECT order_id, category, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details od
LEFT JOIN menu_items mi
ON od.item_id = mi.menu_item_id
WHERE order_id IN (440, 2075, 1957, 2675)
GROUP BY order_id, category;


-- 6. What is the date range of the table
SELECT MIN(order_date), MAX(order_date) FROM order_details;

-- 7. How many orders were made within this date range
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) FROM order_details;

-- 8. Which orders had the most number of items
SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
ORDER BY num_items DESC;

-- 9. How many orders had more than 12 items
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
(SELECT order_id, COUNT(item_id) AS num_items
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING num_items > 12) AS num_orders;


-- 10. What are the least and most expensive Italian dishes on the menu
SELECT *
FROM menu_items
WHERE category = 'Italian'
ORDER BY price;

SELECT *
FROM menu_items
WHERE category = 'Italian'
ORDER BY price DESC;

-- 11. What is the average dish price within each category
SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price
FROM menu_items
GROUP BY category;
